## 💫 What is This Magic?

**Daktylos** is a delightfully crafted [**QMK**](https://qmk.fm) layout for the elegant [**elephant42**](https://github.com/illness072/elephant42) keyboard, inspired by the [**Miryoku Layout**](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku). Daktylos is paired with an optional companion app [**Hidrosis**](./hidrosis) to enable communication between the host and the keyboard.
